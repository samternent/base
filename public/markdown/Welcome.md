variety of pack sizes. They currently have 5 different size packs - 250, 500,
1000, 2000 and 5000. Their customers can order any amount of sweets they
wish but they will only ever be sold full packs. They recently changed their pack
sizes and may change them again in future depending on demand.

  necessary to fulfil the order.
